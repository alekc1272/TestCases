Data Description:
There is data from an accelerometer (a_x, a_y, a_z) and a gyroscope (g_x, g_y, g_z) with a frequency of 10 Hz, with marked periods of meals (target).
Two people ate for about 3 weeks and marked the time intervals (respectively, the markup is binary), during which they ate.

Tasks:
1. You Should explore data.
2. Train a model that will predict food gaps.
3. Calculate Precision, Recall, F1 metrics for the resulting model (can be considered pointwise, you can receive the events of receptions).
